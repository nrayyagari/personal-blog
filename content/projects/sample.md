This post is about how me and [Avijit](https://twitter.com/526avijit) retrieved multiplie cyberoam username/password combinations using python. This also highlights how vulnerable the system is if you are not using a more secure password . Even the default password given to us by the College are being recycled for many years.

### DISCLAIMER
Before you read this, I want to clarify that we do not intend to use our findings in any unethical way. No username-password combinations will be disclosed. The purpose of writing this blog was to notify possible victims to prevent their ID from being used by someone else.

### What is Cyberoam ?
Its a network gateway software which requires students to login to use the internet.

## How we did it ?
I wrote a simple python script which basically sends multiple requests to the server with varying username & password combinations. It checks whether the combination is correct and if it is correct , the combination is stored in a file. I wrote that script to iterate over 2000 users and check 16 passwords, basically sending around 32,000 requests.
