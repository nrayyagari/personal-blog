Hey there! I'm Nitin, a Cloud Engineer based in India, and yes, my name is a palindrome â€“ how cool is that? ðŸ™‚. In the vast expanse of the internet, this blog is my cozy nook where I share my technical adventures and musings on all things geeky (and sometimes not-so-geeky too!).

My journey began with a MS degree in Networking and Cloud Computing from BTH, Sweden. After working at a startup called Flux7, I took an unconventional detour and tried my hand at India's Civil Services Exams. While I didn't achieve the success I hoped for, the experience taught me invaluable lessons in perseverance and adaptability.

Eventually, I found my way back to the tech world, where I thrive on tackling challenges head-on. My go-to tools? Linux, AWS services, Python, Kubernetes, CI/CD toolchains, and Observability, to name a few. But here's the thing: *I'm always ready to learn whatever it takes to get the job done*. Case in point: I once had to learn and use ClearCase, a decade-old IBM SCM, to complete a task as there were none on how to use it!

When I'm not at work, you'll find me cheering on my favorite players and teams(Tennis, Football, and Test Cricket, anyone?). I firmly believe that sport has a lot to teach us about life, and I try to apply those lessons both on and off the field. To keep my body and mind in sync, I love swinging my Jump rope aka skipping, going on drives, and trying new dishes in the kitchen. Life's all about balance, right?

So, there you have it â€“ a little glimpse into my world. Feel free to reach out to me at [email] or connect with me on [social media links]. I'm always eager to meet new people and learn from their experiences
