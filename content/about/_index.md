Hey there! I'm <u>Nitin</u>, a Software Engineer based in India, and yes, my name is a [**Palindrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) â€“ how cool is that? ðŸ™‚. In this little corner of the internet, I explore my love for technology and share my experiences, both geeky and not-so-geeky.

My journey began with a MS degree in Networking and Cloud Computing from [BTH, Sweden](https://www.bth.se/eng/). After working at a startup called [Flux7](https://us.nttdata.com/en/news/press-release/2019/december/ntt-data-services-to-acquire-flux7-an-aws-premier-consulting-partner), I took an unconventional detour and tried my hand at India's [Civil Services](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64316112). While I didn't get the result I hoped for, the experience taught me invaluable lessons in resilience and adaptability.

Eventually, I found my way back to the tech world, where I thrive on tackling challenges head-on and helping others in resolving their issues. My go-to tools? Linux, AWS, Python, Kubernetes, IaC, CaC, CI/CD toolchain, Observability to name a few. But here's what I live by: ***Learn whatever it takes to get the job done***. Case in point: I once had to learn and use ClearCase, a decade-old IBM SCM, to manage a legacy codebase. 

When I'm not at work, you'll find me cheering on my favorite sportstars and teams(Tennis, Football, and Test Cricket, anyone!?). I believe that sport has a lot to teach us about life, and I try to apply those lessons both on and off the field. 

To keep my body and mind in sync, I love swinging my Jump rope aka skipping, going on long drives, movie nights and experimenting with new food recipes. 

So, there you have it â€“ a little glimpse into my world. Feel free to reach out to me at [nitinayyagari@outlook.com](mailto:nitinayyagari@outlook.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinayyagari/). Cheers!
