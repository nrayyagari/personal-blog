Hi there, I'm Nitin and yes I'm a Palindrome!

I'm Cloud Engineer based out of Hyderabad, India currently. This blog is small space I created amidst the vast space of Internet
I intend to share my Technical learnings/experiences under https://nitinayyagari.com/posts/ and thoughts on Generic topics under https://nitinayyagari.com/general/

My career path is not linear. I did my Masters from BTH, Sweden in the field of Networking and Cloud Computing. There after working for a 
startup called Flux7, I took an unusual path of trying for Civil services in India. Having found only limited success there, I switched
back to my Tech career again. 

On the Tech Side, I mainly deal with Linux, AWS Services, Python, Kubernetes, CICD toolchain and *learn whatever needs to be learnt to get the job done*. 
Testament to this: I had to learn and use ClearCase, a decade old IBM SCM to get a task done as there was no one aware of it in our company! 

Other than work, I love watching sports esp. Tennis, Football and sometimes Test Cricket! I believe Sport has a lot to teach and inspire us

Occasionally I also try few recipes and currently learning how to cook Country Chicken(my fav too!)
